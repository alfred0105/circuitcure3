# CircuitCare AI

**Local, lightweight AI-assisted circuit fault propagation analysis and repair prioritization.**

CircuitCare AI aims to answer a practical repair question: **if one component has failed, which *other* components might have been affected, why, and what should be checked next?**

> **Status: integrated local prototype; Phase 21.0 audit is recorded and Phase 21.0.1 roadmap alignment is complete, with responsive browser verification still open.** Existing capabilities include KiCad/netlist analysis, supported SPICE scenarios, stress/risk review, conditional diagnosis and measurement suggestions, schematic and PCB candidate views, and evidence-grounded reports. The three competition research claims are electrical connectivity reconstruction, physics-informed fault reasoning, and active-measurement efficiency. No physical repair accuracy or real-board electrical connectivity performance has been established. Risk levels, detector scores, heuristic matches, and Bayesian weights do **not** establish damage or real-world failure probability.

### Validation at a glance

- Synthetic fault benchmark: 10 cases / 5 topology groups; repeated runs are not independent cases. Rules exact precision .0495 and recall 1.0; LLM exact precision/recall 0; combined methods showed no exact-diagnosis gain over Rules. See [Phase 17 results](docs/PHASE17_EVALUATION.md) and [Phase 17.1 correction](docs/PHASE17_1_EVALUATION_HOTFIX.md).
- PCB detector: source-provided validation split, 13 images / 196 boxes; precision .498, recall .612, recomputed mAP@.5 .585 (AP uses a 0.001 prediction floor). Board split independence and reviewed labels are not verified; this is not a board-level accuracy claim. See [Phase 21.3 benchmark](docs/PHASE21_3_BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md).
- PRISM: 12 boards / 24 sides passed through image processing; no image-to-design calibration, valid pixel accuracy metrics, or electrical connectivity validation. See [PRISM benchmark](docs/PHASE20_1_1_PRISM_BENCHMARK.md).
- Active-measurement policy benefit: `NOT_EVALUATED`; expected-information-gain selection exists, but no matched Random / Rule / EIG efficiency experiment exists.

### Phase 18.1.1 stability work

Graph traversal now enforces global queue, expanded-state, result, depth, and optional time budgets; partial results are labelled. The dashboard selects one analysis area per rerun. PDF and PCB image work uses bounded content-based caches. ngspice result files are parsed as streams under file, sample, and vector ceilings. Crash diagnostics and test tiers are described in [Crash Diagnostics](docs/CRASH_DIAGNOSTICS_GUIDE.md), [Stress Tests](docs/STRESS_TEST_GUIDE.md), [Full Code Stability Audit](docs/FULL_CODE_STABILITY_AUDIT.md), and [Phase 18.1.1 results](docs/PHASE18_1_1_CRASH_STABILITY.md).

Run the fast suite with `python -m pytest -q -m "not integration and not stress"`, native integrations with `python -m pytest -q -m integration`, and synthetic stress coverage with `python -m pytest -q -m stress`. The previously reported Python termination remains unattributed because no crash log was supplied.

## Current prototype and target product

**Current prototype:** the user selects a circuit and a supported fault component/mode. CircuitCare evaluates candidate connectivity, runs supported normal-vs-fault SPICE analyses, compares stress with configured ratings, and ranks conditional Bayesian hypotheses and measurement candidates. PCB Vision and multiview reconstruction are partial; their electrical connectivity accuracy has not been verified on a CircuitCare physical board.

**Target product:** start with multiview PCB photos and a natural-language symptom, even when the user does not know the failed component. The system will structure symptoms into module and fault candidates, analyze root cause separately from possible secondary stress, recommend measurements, accept measured values, and guide repair. When a net or cause is uncertain, it must ask for design data, user confirmation, or additional measurements, or show explicitly limited candidates. It must not present an LLM hypothesis, image-derived contact, simulated rating stress, or conditional Bayesian score as a confirmed failure.

## Quick start

Requires Python 3.11+ (Python 3.11 is the CI baseline; Python 3.12 also works).

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,ui,vision,datasheet]"
circuitcare --netlist tests/fixtures/simple_kicad_netlist.xml --fault U1
python -m pytest -q
streamlit run src/circuitcare/ui.py
```

The [Phase 18 User Guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md) walks through the dashboard. Report examples are in [`examples/phase18_demo/`](examples/phase18_demo/); regenerate them with `python scripts/build_phase18_demo_report.py`.

CI는 Python 3.11에서 `dev`, `vision`, `datasheet` 테스트 의존성을 설치합니다. PDF 테스트는 공식 데이터시트나 LLM 모델을 다운로드하지 않고 합성 PDF로 실행됩니다. Vision은 실행 시 선택 기능이지만, 현재 전체 테스트 수집에는 NumPy/OpenCV/Pillow가 필요합니다.

For the integrated dashboard, install the optional UI dependency and start Streamlit:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[ui]"
streamlit run src/circuitcare/ui.py
```

To enable the **데이터시트 AI** tab's local PDF text/table extraction, install the optional PDF readers too:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[ui,datasheet]"
streamlit run src/circuitcare/ui.py
```

The tab uses `pypdf` and `pdfplumber`; local LLM structuring reuses the loopback-only Ollama integration. Candidate values are never applied until their cited source, MPN-to-Reference mapping, conditions, and human approval are confirmed. See [Datasheet AI guide](docs/DATASHEET_AI_GUIDE.md) and [Phase 14 evaluation](docs/PHASE14_EVALUATION.md).

To enable the optional local PCB photo workflow (OpenCV, NumPy, and Pillow), install the vision extra too:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[ui,vision]"
streamlit run src/circuitcare/ui.py
```

The **PCB 사진 인식** tab can run optional local detector/OCR candidates and, separately, align a photo to KiCad Component Position CSV using a manually confirmed homography. Risk is attached to a detection only after the user confirms the matching KiCad reference and board identity. See the [PCB Vision guide](docs/PCB_VISION_GUIDE.md). The current detector benchmark on 13 source validation images / 196 boxes reports mAP@0.5 0.585 with a 0.001 AP prediction floor. Source labels are unreviewed and board IDs are absent, so this is not board-independent or CircuitCare design-matching validation. No matching real-board photo/design data is available. The Phase 11 CI hotfix passed on Python 3.11 in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/alfred0105/CircuitCare-AI/actions/runs/41570036079) (29 tests).

Optional AI setup: `python -m pip install -e ".[ui,vision,vision-ai,vision-ocr]"`, then `python scripts/prepare_pcb_detector.py`. The model exporter is installed separately by the user and is not part of the runtime package. See [setup and artifact provenance](docs/PCB_AI_DETECTION.md) and [evaluation limits](docs/PCB_AI_EVALUATION.md).

The **분석 개요** tab provides a Component–Net fault influence candidate map with separate connectivity, electrical-stress, and conditional inspection-priority views. The **AI 고장 가설 분석** tab proposes candidates from the explicit fault catalog and local Ollama, validates each proposal against circuit/SPICE mappings, and runs ngspice only after explicit user selection. Simulation fit applies only to the configured model and observations. U1 What-if controls recalculate Bayesian outputs from a `simulated_demo` virtual measurement; they do not change actual measurement records or rerun SPICE. See [Fault Hypothesis AI](docs/FAULT_HYPOTHESIS_AI.md), [Phase 15 evaluation](docs/PHASE15_EVALUATION.md), [Datasheet benchmark](docs/DATASHEET_EXTRACTION_BENCHMARK.md), the [fault map guide](docs/FAULT_MAP_GUIDE.md), and [What-if guide](docs/WHAT_IF_DIAGNOSIS.md).

The dashboard has circuit/fault, SPICE, rating risk, Bayesian diagnosis, local LLM, PCB photo, datasheet review, AI fault hypothesis, **수리 이력 및 AI 학습**, and **AI 성능 평가** tabs. The benchmark tab reads saved runs only and does not launch LLM or SPICE evaluation. See [Benchmark Methodology](docs/BENCHMARK_METHODOLOGY.md). Repair data stays in the ignored local `data/private/repair_feedback/repair_cases.sqlite3` database; it is not uploaded to GitHub. See [Repair Feedback guide](docs/REPAIR_FEEDBACK_GUIDE.md), [Prior Learning guide](docs/PRIOR_LEARNING_GUIDE.md), and [Phase 16 evaluation](docs/PHASE16_EVALUATION.md). It opens the saved 5 V→8 V regulator demo by default; the divider and RC charging examples can also be run with ngspice. Simulation status distinguishes `CACHED`, `RUNNING`, `SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, and `NOT_RUN`; failed reruns do not keep a previous live result active. User measurements and simulated demo measurements are distinguished. The saved U1 3/6/8 V Bayesian set is shown only in its matching regulator demo context; it is identified as stored scenario evidence, separate from the selected live run. Ollama is called only after an explicit user action. Without Ollama, deterministic advice and rule-based fault/datasheet candidates remain available.

For an offline presentation, install the package, ngspice, and (if desired) an Ollama model before disconnecting from the internet. Ollama models are not committed to this repository. Run `python scripts/demo_check.py` before the event to verify local prerequisites and cached data without repeating circuit simulations.

### Fixed demonstration sequence

1. **U1 overvoltage:** select the default cached regulator case. Compare 5 V baseline and 8 V fault, inspect C1 at 8 V / 6.3 V = 1.2698 utilization (`EXCEEDED`) and RLOAD at 16 mW / 125 mW = 0.128 (`WITHIN_LIMIT`). These are configured demonstration ratings, not datasheet-verified values.
2. **Bayesian example:** use the saved `simulated_demo` VOUT 7.9 V ± 0.2 V observation; the conditional 8 V hypothesis weight becomes approximately 1.0. This is not an instrument reading or a real failure probability.
3. **Independent resistor divider:** R1 changes from 1 kΩ to 10 kΩ; the saved/live ngspice VOUT changes from 2.5000 V to 0.4545 V.
4. **Independent RC charging:** RCHARGE changes from 10 kΩ to 100 kΩ; the committed transient has 545 samples across 0–50 ms, with VC at the final sample changing from 0.24325 V to 0.02488 V.

Stored results can be displayed when ngspice is unavailable. `scripts/demo_check.py` reports ngspice and Ollama availability separately and always identifies the deterministic fallback. See [the five-minute script](docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md), [the release checklist](docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md), and [poster content](docs/POSTER_CONTENT.md). To regenerate the poster figure, install the optional plotting extra with `python -m pip install -e ".[poster]"` and run `python scripts/make_poster_figures.py`.

To inspect parsed component metadata and pin-to-net connections, add `--show-pins`:

```bash
circuitcare --netlist tests/fixtures/simple_kicad_netlist.xml --fault U1 --show-pins
```

To list direct and indirect connectivity paths (two component hops by default), use `--show-paths`. Export the bipartite graph as DOT with `--export-dot`:

```bash
circuitcare --netlist tests/fixtures/simple_kicad_netlist.xml --fault U1 --show-paths --max-hops 2
circuitcare --netlist tests/fixtures/simple_kicad_netlist.xml --fault U1 --export-dot circuit_graph.dot
```

Net types are unknown unless explicitly supplied in a JSON mapping such as `{"GND":"ground","VIN":"power","VOUT":"power","SIGNAL":"signal"}` using `--net-types net-types.json`. `--exclude-net-types ground` filters ground paths from path traversal while retaining them in the graph and direct connectivity results. This filter does not imply that a real effect cannot travel through GND.

Generate a faulted SPICE circuit using the explicit KiCad-to-SPICE mapping and starter circuit:

```bash
circuitcare --netlist tests/fixtures/fault_demo_netlist.xml --fault R1 \
  --fault-type resistance_drift --fault-value 10k \
  --spice-base data/circuits/fault_demo.cir \
  --spice-mapping data/circuits/fault_demo_mapping.json \
  --output data/fault_scenarios
```

This writes `baseline.cir`, a faulted `.cir`, and `scenarios.json`. Supported scenarios include resistor open/short/drift, ideal regulator output rise/drop/loss, and mapped voltage-controlled switch stuck-open/stuck-on. These are stated approximations; scenario generation does not run a simulator. The committed `data/fault_scenarios/` files show resistor open, short, and 10 kΩ drift examples.

To run both baseline and faulted decks with ngspice and compare probe data, add `--simulate` and `--probes`:

```bash
circuitcare --netlist tests/fixtures/fault_demo_netlist.xml --fault R1 \
  --fault-type resistance_drift --fault-value 10k \
  --spice-base data/circuits/fault_demo.cir \
  --spice-mapping data/circuits/fault_demo_mapping.json \
  --output data/fault_scenarios/example_001 \
  --simulate --probes data/circuits/fault_demo_probes.json
```

ngspice must be installed (`brew install ngspice` on macOS). The runner saves logs and CSV samples; comparison and component stress summaries are JSON. The example uses a 5 V source and two 1 kΩ resistors: LOAD measures 2.5 V at baseline and about 0.455 V with R1 at 10 kΩ. Resistor current/power use the mapped terminals and actual netlist resistance; ideal voltage-source current comes from ngspice. Unsupported switch current/power are left null. These are simulated electrical changes, not damage or rating assessments.

The included sample intentionally connects U1 to J1, U2 and C3; R4 is present as a non-directly-connected comparison. A shared net is **a candidate influence path, not evidence of damage**. The CLI reports the selected failed component, total component count, direct candidates, shared nets, and connectivity-only evidence level.

To compare fault-case stress against explicit component ratings and create `risk_assessment.json`, add `--ratings` and `--assess-risk`:

```bash
circuitcare --netlist tests/fixtures/fault_demo_netlist.xml --fault U1 \
  --fault-type regulator_output_rise --fault-value 8 \
  --spice-base data/circuits/fault_demo.cir \
  --spice-mapping data/circuits/fault_demo_mapping.json \
  --output data/fault_scenarios/overvoltage_demo \
  --simulate --probes data/circuits/fault_demo_probes.json \
  --ratings data/component_specs/fault_demo_ratings.json --assess-risk
```

The demo raises the ideal 5 V output to 8 V. C1 is measured at 8 V against an explicitly labeled, unverified 6.3 V demo assumption (utilization 1.27, `EXCEEDED`). RLOAD dissipates 16 mW against a 125 mW demo assumption (`WITHIN_LIMIT`). Those rating values are illustrative and are not verified against component datasheets. The priority score is an explainable inspection ordering index, never a damage probability. Missing ratings or probes remain `UNKNOWN`; Q1 is excluded from physical ranking because its fixture pins do not map consistently to the SPICE switch terminals. Capacitor current, ESR loss, and heating are not calculated.

Run prior-only diagnosis from stored SPICE and risk JSON, then rerun with a measurement:

```bash
circuitcare-diagnose --hypotheses data/diagnosis/demo_hypotheses.json \
  --output data/diagnosis/prior_results
circuitcare-diagnose --hypotheses data/diagnosis/demo_hypotheses.json \
  --measurements data/diagnosis/demo_measurements.json \
  --output data/diagnosis/posterior_results
```

The three hypotheses reference saved 3 V, 6 V, and 8 V ngspice results; predicted node voltages are loaded from each `comparison.json`, not embedded in the diagnosis code. Priors are equal weights, and voltage measurement σ=0.2 V is a labeled demo assumption. The example 7.9 V observation is marked `simulated_demo`; it moves the 8 V hypothesis from 1/3 prior weight to approximately 1.0 conditional posterior. Before measurement, VOUT has the highest calculated information gain; after measuring VOUT it is excluded, and the remaining LOAD prediction is not informative enough to recommend another measurement. Outputs contain posterior history, measurement recommendations, and prior/posterior weighted inspection indices. These conditional values are not real-world failure probabilities, and measurement suggestions do not authorize live probing.

For evidence-backed repair guidance, install Ollama separately and pull a local model (for example, `ollama pull qwen3:4b-instruct`). The advisor never sends data to a cloud API. It checks the local Ollama model list, uses only evidence JSON from the diagnosis, inspection ranking, measurement recommendation, and optional risk/stress reports, then writes `repair_advice.json`, `evidence.json`, and `llm_explanation.json`:

```bash
circuitcare-advise \
  --diagnosis data/diagnosis/posterior_results/diagnosis.json \
  --inspection-ranking data/diagnosis/posterior_results/inspection_ranking.json \
  --measurement-recommendations data/diagnosis/posterior_results/measurement_recommendations.json \
  --model qwen3:4b-instruct \
  --question 'C1을 왜 먼저 점검해야 해?' \
  --output data/repair_advice/example
```

Use `--no-llm` to produce deterministic isolation, inspection, replacement, and post-repair checks without model inference. An installed local model can be selected with `--model`; Phase 08 was exercised with `gemma4:12b` on Ollama 0.40.3. Ollama 0.40.3 does not support structured output for this model, so the client retries once in plain-text mode and validates the returned JSON and evidence references locally. Model explanations are rejected on invalid or unsupported claims, leaving the deterministic advice available. Output labels simulation/demo assumptions and unknowns separately; the model is not allowed to assert damage or convert conditional posterior weights into real failure probabilities.

## Current implementation and next phase

Phases 01–10 provide the electrical-analysis workflow; Phase 11 adds manual PCB photo alignment, Phase 12 adds optional local detector/OCR review, Phase 13 adds interactive visualization and an isolated What-if preview, Phase 14 adds locally processed datasheets with evidence-gated rating review, and Phase 15 adds local fault proposals with physics checks. Electrical evaluation is in [the final evaluation record](docs/FINAL_EVALUATION.md), with the [Phase 09 summary](data/evaluations/phase09_summary.json); run `python scripts/evaluate.py` to regenerate the latter. PCB model evidence and limits are in [the Phase 12 evaluation](docs/PCB_AI_EVALUATION.md); datasheet evidence and limits are documented separately in [Phase 14 evaluation](docs/PHASE14_EVALUATION.md) and [the Phase 15 benchmark](docs/DATASHEET_EXTRACTION_BENCHMARK.md). Evaluation and timing values describe the recorded local environment and are not general performance guarantees. Only explicitly supplied ratings and supported measurements are evaluated. Posterior weights are conditional on the configured hypothesis set and do not estimate real-world failure probability or confirm damage.

The figures in [the poster content](docs/POSTER_CONTENT.md) are generated from committed JSON/CSV evidence by `python scripts/make_poster_figures.py`. Evaluation is limited to two independent small circuit topologies and a separate regulator Bayesian demo. There are no independent damaged-part labels, so damage-detection accuracy, Top-k damage coverage, and avoidable inspections are not claimed. The RSS reported by the evaluation excludes ngspice and Ollama child processes.

## Scope and caution

- The first supported input is a **KiCad XML netlist** (e.g. exported using KiCad's schematic netlist export).
- Photo-derived electrical connectivity, external cloud APIs, and automated energization of damaged boards are **out of scope** for the competition MVP. Optional detector boxes remain visual candidates.
- Distinguish **known failed**, **potentially affected**, **measured abnormal**, and **confirmed damaged** components.
- Do not report calibrated failure percentages without real failure-rate/validation data.
- Tests and simulations are not substitutes for safety checks, isolation, and current-limited professional measurement.

## 증상 기반 PCB 진단 엔진

`src/circuitcare/symptom_diagnosis/`에 증상·관찰·측정값을 바탕으로 고장 후보를 순위화하는 엔진을 추가했습니다. 기존 Frontend Workbench V2는 `CIRCUITCARE_UI_V2=1`로 실행할 수 있습니다. 기본은 YAML 규칙 기반이며 Ollama 로컬 LLM은 선택 사항입니다. 사용법, 근거 제한, 준비 방법은 [증상 진단 안내](docs/SYMPTOM_DIAGNOSIS.md)를 참고하세요.
